Reactive Agents – Respond to inputs without memory (e.g., a bot that gives real-time crypto prices).

Deliberative Agents – Use reasoning to make decisions (e.g., analyzing market trends before suggesting trades).

Learning Agents – Improve over time using machine learning (e.g., AI that refines predictions based on past data).

Autonomous Agents – Act on their own with minimal human input (e.g., automated trading bots).
